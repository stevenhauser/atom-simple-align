# Atom simple align package

**This package is no longer maintained.**

A simple package to align multiple cursors, and that's it. *Why create another alignment package when there are already a ton of them?* Because for what I wanted they were too complicated and tried to intelligently align on given characters, add spaces before or after characters, etc, and they gave unexpected results sometimes.
